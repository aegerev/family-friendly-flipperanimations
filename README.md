# Family-Friendly Flipper Animations

## Description
This is a list of animations for the Flipper Zero that are FAMILY-FRIENDLY üß∏. The purpose is to provide fun, appropriate visuals for the device's screen.

## Installation
No third-party applications were installed during the making of this project. The animations are designed to be compatible with the Flipper Zero's standard operating environment.

## Usage
If a person has a Flipper Zero, they can use the qFlipper Desktop App to download and transfer the animation files to their device. NOTE: You must update the manifest.txt file for the animations to load and appear correctly on the Flipper Zero. Consult the official Flipper Zero documentation for the proper procedure on modifying the manifest.txt file for custom assets. üíæ

I also imported code to show how you turn a .png file into Flipper Zero .bm files. NOTE: This has two pictures side by side. I need only one. If someone knows how to do this in Python, it will be greatly appreciated.

Happy flipping! üê¨
